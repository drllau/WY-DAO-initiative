# Guidance for prospective LexDAO Mentor(s)

Welcome to a Brave new World

LexDAO appreciates you taking your valuable time in inspiring new rogues. Your role is broadly a mix of:
* 40% **Counsel** - making sure apprentices stay within the bounds of the problem brief;
* 30% **Coach** - help professional development by giving honest feedback about their performance;
* 20% **Cheer Leader** - encourage them by personal anecdotes on how you got to where you are now;

We are competing with law firms (compliance) and courts (complaints) as an alternative career path. As Ross puts it
> In law school you're taught to think big about what the law is meant to accomplish, but law firms are not paid to think. No one cares about your theories. It kills training for lawyers.  - Ross

The DAO means you can bootstrap your own mini-constitution (community) or micro-charter (commercial) which means new skills are required:
1. writing bylaws/workflow with token mechanisms to bridge between Web3 primitives and the human norms;
2. envisaging and mitigating the various resulting scenarios (bad leaver) or transaction failures (buggy code);
3. electronic dispute resolution via neutral mediation or technical self-help (problem-solving).

## Unique Features
* Peer programming - pair up a law student with software dev to cross-train each other in the basics, encourage them to write wikis to explain the basics (self-discovery) as your role is to identity the knowledge gaps, then point to right direction, **not** be a lecturer (role of law school)
* Weekly [standup](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups) reviews - recorded so need to be succinct (time pressure) as well as prepared (effective use of group mentoring time);
* Peer [assessment](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/360-degree-feedback-information-1917537) - rather than grading, apprentices compare others relative to their study partner so you need to encourage them where did well or can improve.
